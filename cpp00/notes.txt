===============New Concepts================

	---------------Overloading----------------

		Defining multiple functions (iterations) and operators with the same name.


	---------------Type Safety----------------
	
		Compile-time checking of types.
		Overloading is type safe because the compiler can determine which iteration of a function to call based on the types of the arguments.

	---------Orthodox Canonical Form----------

		- order of member variables and functions
			- public functions
			- protected functions
			- private functions
			- public variables
			- protected variables
			- private variables
		- use const whenever possible
		- use initialization lists to initialize member variables in the constructor


	--------------New Keywords----------------

		- Constructor
			- always exists, even if not defined
			- purpose is to initialize member variables

		- public
			- accessible to all
		- private
			- accessible only to the class
			- private variables and functions begin with an underscore
		- protected
			- accessible to the class and its derived classes (classes that inherit this class)
		- virtual
			- allows derived classes to override the function
		- override
			- overrides a virtual function
		- static
			- a class member can be static, which means it is shared by all instances of the class
			- there does not have to be an instance created to access a static member
		- this
			- refers to the current instance of the class
		- new
			- creates new instance of an object on the heap
