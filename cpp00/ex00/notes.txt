===============New Concepts================

	---------------Overloading----------------

		Defining multiple functions (iterations) and operators with the same name.


	---------------Type Safety----------------
	
		Compile-time checking of types.
		Overloading is type safe because the compiler can determine which iteration of a function to call based on the types of the arguments.
